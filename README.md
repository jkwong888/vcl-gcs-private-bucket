# vcl-gcs-private-bucket

terraform that basically creates a private GCS bucket and spits out the code example as defined [here](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/examples/google-cloud-storage-origin-(private)).  the only really dynamic section is `init.vcl` which you can find in the generated directory after it gets generated.
